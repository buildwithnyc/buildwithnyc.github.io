      <p class="lead">The Product Management Fellow will focus on supporting <a href="https://medium.com/nyc-opportunity/my-file-nyc-path-pilot-case-study-28c5e4ca0428">My File NYC</a>, an open source site that allows residents to store and share documents for social services. It gives residents control of their personal information, reduces the time for establishing eligibility for benefits, and reduces the repetition of the document upload process each time residents apply for services.  
</p>
      <p class="lead">They will also support other products including new tools to help visualize the <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/opportunity/poverty-in-nyc/poverty-measure.page">City’s poverty data</a> to encourage data-driven decision making and transparency.
