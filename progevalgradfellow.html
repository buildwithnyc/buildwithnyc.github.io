      <!--<p><strong>The application window for the Mayor’s Office for Economic Opportunity Fellowships is now closed.</strong></p> -->

      <p class="lead">The Mayor’s Office for Economic Opportunity (NYC Opportunity) helps the City apply evidence and innovation to reduce poverty and increase equity. We advance research, data, and design in program and policy development, service delivery, and budget decisions. Our work includes analyzing existing anti-poverty approaches, developing new interventions, facilitating the sharing of data across City agencies, and rigorously assessing the impact of key initiatives.</p>

      
      <p class="lead">The Programs and Evaluation (P&E) team partners with City agencies to design, manage, and assess innovative anti-poverty and equity strategies. We draw on our expertise in implementation, evaluation, and continuous quality improvement, and have designed and managed over 100 human services programs and systems-change initiatives in partnership with over 30 City agencies and Mayoral offices.</p>

      <p class="lead">The P&E team engages in program development and management, and performance and fiscal monitoring for projects within our portfolio, and help partners develop appropriate performance monitoring metrics for their programs and initiatives. We work across a diverse array of priority policy areas and populations, including: workforce development and advancement; financial empowerment, asset building, and cash transfers; education; health and mental health; homelessness; immigration and naturalization; opportunity youth; legal system-involved youth and adults, and others. Where initiatives show promise, the P&E team leads evaluations of projects in our portfolio, as well as priority citywide programs and services for disadvantaged New Yorkers. Our evaluations are led by an in-house team in partnership with City agencies, and conducted by one of our independent evaluation firms.</p>
