      <h1><b><font color="#2F334F">Service Design Fellow</font></b></h1>
  
      <p class="lead">The Mayor’s Office for Economic Opportunity (NYC Opportunity) helps the City apply evidence and
innovation to reduce poverty and increase equity. Using the tools of data, design, and research, we
partner with agencies to improve the systems of government and make the City’s social service
programs more effective, efficient, and responsive. NYC Opportunity supports policy development
and budget decisions and works to center equity as a core governing principle across government.
We also produce research and analysis of poverty and social conditions, including through our
influential annual NYCgov Poverty Measure, which we developed to provide a more accurate picture
of poverty in New York City than the federal rate. </p> 

      <p class = "lead">The Service Design Studio (“the Studio”) helps spread valuable service design and
community-centered design methodologies often underused in government. The Studio builds the
City's design capacity with consultation, technical assistance, and skills-building opportunities. We
collaborate with City agency partners to enhance existing services or design new ones that are
effective, accessible, and dignified. Our approach begins with understanding the needs of people
who use, deliver, and administer public services. We seek feedback from different perspectives and
test prototypes of service enhancements before implementing them at scale.</p>
     
     <p class="lead">The Service Design Studio is seeking emerging community-conscious leaders interested in service
design, public administration, social services, and/or community organizing. We are looking for
applicants for a 9-month fellowship, starting in October 2025 through June 2026.
The Service Design Studio sits within the Mayor’s Office for Economic Opportunity. We help further
the City’s use of community-centered design and research methods. We partner with City agencies
to engage with residents and those who deliver services so that their voices and insights can shape
new and existing services.
We are looking for a wide range of design skills. Fellows will support the Studio in a variety of ways,
such as co-facilitating design research activities and participatory workshops, supporting in the
development of visual design materials (such as decks, flyers, infographics, etc.), and producing
communications assets (such as blog posts, case studies, and other forms of media).</p>
