      <p class="lead">Within NYC Opportunity the Poverty Research Unit (PRU) publishes the <a href="http://www1.nyc.gov/site/opportunity/poverty-in-nyc/poverty-measure.page">NYCgov poverty measure</a> for New York City that is a nationally recognized metric for evaluating and targeting policies intended to reduce poverty.
The NYCgov poverty measure has become an important tool for evaluating policies, assessing the progress the city has made over time in reducing poverty, and designing new policies to reduce current levels of economic deprivation.  NYC Opportunity also releases an annual brief on the economic condition of immigrants in New York City, connecting economic outcomes to legal status. 
</p>
      <p class="lead">We are seeking an interested candidate for a technical fellow position specializing in developing and implementing measures of poverty and economic mobility. This paid fellowship offers flexible hours, from 20-40 hours per week, with a minimum one-year commitment desired. The first three months of the fellowship will require in-person work from our Downtown Brooklyn office. After this period, there is the possibility to telework at least some hours remotely, depending on committed hours and scheduling. </p>
        
        <p>The anticipated start date is September/October 2025. </p>

Fellows will be closely involved with this model and use multiple federal, state and local data sets including survey and administrative data.</p>-->
          <p>Technical fellows will collaborate closely with PRU staff on multiple research projects that involve data processing, statistical analysis, and report writing. </p>
          <p>Examples of specific responsibilities could include:</p>
            <ul class="panel-bullets">
              <li>Supporting the modeling of policy alternatives and their comparative outcomes (e.g., anti-poverty impacts, distributional consequences, and fiscal efficiency).</li>
              <li>Assisting in assessing the statistical soundness of models, reviewing model performance, and recommending action plans to address deficiencies.</li>
            <li>Contributing to report writing and blog posts.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Fellows will primarily work under a supervisor who will assist with prioritization and workflow, but assignments will come from various sources within the office. Fellows will work on several specific projects and/or develop an area of specialization, have opportunities to work independently and as part of a team, and fully participate in the activities of a fast-paced mayoral office.</p>
